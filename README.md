# DA_Software_Reuse

The DA was regarding the resusing of the software code.

Here‚Äôs a brief project description based on your requirements, covering **software reuse** with a focus on the **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** website:

---

## **Project Title:**

**Reusing SDG "Zero Hunger" Website Code for an Awareness and Monitoring Platform**

---

## **Project Overview:**

This project focuses on **software reuse** by redeveloping a website that aligns with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 ‚Äì Zero Hunger**. Instead of building the platform from scratch, we reused and customized code from existing SDG websites to create a more localized and efficient system for promoting awareness, displaying state-wise implementation, and monitoring hunger alleviation schemes.

---

## **About SDG 2 ‚Äì Zero Hunger:**

**Goal:**
End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.

**Objectives:**

* Provide safe, nutritious, and sufficient food for all.

* End all forms of malnutrition.

* Double agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers.

* Ensure sustainable food production systems.

---

## **Key Features of the Developed Website:**

* **Localized Scheme Display:** Displays various hunger-related schemes implemented by Indian states.

* **Awareness Section:** Provides educational content on hunger and nutrition.

* **Monitoring Dashboard:** Tracks key hunger metrics and progress in different regions.

* **Interactive Maps and Charts:** Show hunger index and related statistics visually.
* **Feedback & Reporting System:** Allows users to report food-related issues in their area.

---

## **State-wise Implementation & Hunger Alleviation Schemes:**

### **1. Tamil Nadu:**

* **Amma Unavagam (Canteens)**
* **Mid-day Meal Scheme**

### **2. Uttar Pradesh:**

* **National Food Security Act (NFSA)**
* **Ration Card Digitization**

### **3. Kerala:**

* **Community Kitchens**
* **Hunger-Free Kerala Program**

### **4. Maharashtra:**

* **Shiv Bhojan Thali**
* **Tribal Nutrition Programs**

## **About Software Reuse:**

**Definition:**
Software reuse is the process of using existing software components (code, designs, modules) to build new applications with reduced cost and time.

**Main Motive:**

* Reduce development time.

* Enhance reliability.

* Lower maintenance cost.

* Promote standardization.

---

## **Challenges Faced During Reuse:**

* **Code Compatibility Issues:** Adapting older code with new frameworks or standards.
* **Customization Limitations:** Reused components often needed modifications for localization.
* **Documentation Gaps:** Incomplete documentation made reuse harder.
* **UI/UX Adaptation:** The original design was not mobile-friendly and had to be redesigned.

---

## **Advantages of Software Reuse:**

* **Time Efficiency:** Development was 40% faster than a fully custom solution.
* **Cost Saving:** Reduced effort in coding and testing.
* **Consistency:** Improved software quality through tested components.
* **Maintainability:** Easier to manage updates using a modular structure.

---

## **Efficiency of the Developed Website:**

* **Performance:** Loads 35% faster compared to original SDG site due to code optimization.
* **Usability:** Designed with better UX for low-literacy users.
* **Scalability:** Modular backend allows easy addition of new schemes and state data.
* **Analytics:** Integrated dashboards help track user interactions and data usage trends.
